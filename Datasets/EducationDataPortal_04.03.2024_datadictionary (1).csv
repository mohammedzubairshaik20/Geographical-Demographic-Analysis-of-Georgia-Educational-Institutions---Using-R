For example, the credit hour activity for a 3-credit course with an enrollment of 30 students is 90 credit hours. Using this as a guide, institutions were asked to compute the credit hours attempted for each course and sum the activity for all credit hour courses over the total 12-month period.

However, if three students completed their program, but the remaining three only completed half the program, the institution should report 1,800 hours for the first three students and 900 hours for the second group, or a total of 2,700 hours toward the 12-month total.","Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System"

For institutions with a quarter plan, graduate FTE is the number of graduate credit hours divided by 36.The 12-month FTE for first-professional students was calculated using the unduplicated headcounts reported on the 12-month enrollment component. Since the 12-month unduplicated headcounts do not differentiate between full-time and part-time students, an estimation was used. The ratio of full-time to part-time first-professional students from the previous collection year fall enrollment (which corresponds to the same academic year students) was calculated, and this ratio is applied to the 12-month unduplicated headcount. Adding the resulting full-time and one-third part-time student estimates results in the FTE for first-professional students.","Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System"
